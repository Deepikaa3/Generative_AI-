Project Name: LSTM-Based Next Word Prediction Model in NLP

Description:
This project aims to develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model for predicting the next word in a sequence within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model leverages LSTM's ability to capture long-term dependencies and contextual nuances in language, enhancing prediction accuracy and context understanding in various NLP tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and speech recognition.

Files Included:
1. naan.ipynb: Python script containing code for data preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and prediction using the LSTM-based next word prediction model.
2. Pride and Prejudice.txt: Text file listing all the dependencies required to run the project. Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.
3. data/: Directory containing the dataset used for training and evaluation. Data preprocessing steps are included in the naan.py script.
4. README.md: Markdown file providing instructions, project overview, usage guidelines, and additional information about the project.
